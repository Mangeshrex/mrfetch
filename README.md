# Requirements 
- Material design icons as for that pac-man and ghost icons. 
- You need to put the provided fonts in the fonts directory to get the icons work. 
- If wanted you can change the source code of the fetch as per your needs. 
- If you already use material-design-icons you can just use the above command to install it.  
- Soon rxfetch will be available in the AUR for arch/arch-based users. 

# Installation 

```
 git clone https://github.com/Mangeshrex/rxfetch
```

If you already have the fonts installed then just this.
```
 wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mangeshrex/rxfetch/main/rxfetch
```

Make the file executable and put rfetch in /bin or your PATH
```
 chmod +x rxfetch
 sudo cp $HOME/rxfetch /usr/bin
```
